# ip-emoji-extension

Based on the [IP address to emoji project](https://github.com/6connect/ip-address-emoji/).

This is a simple browser extension that has two features:
1. Converts IP addresses between emoji and standard format using a convenient text input and button.
2. Converts all standard IP addresses on the current page to emoji with the click of a button.

Simply download the source files and zip up the entire `src` folder if you're in Chrome, or simply specify the extensions folder if you're in Firefox.
